    <h1>Safety Tips for First‑time Sex Toy Users</h1>
    <p>Exploring adult toys can be exciting and empowering, but it's important to do so safely. These practical tips will help ensure your experiences remain pleasurable and worry‑free.</p>
    <p><strong>Choose quality materials:</strong> Invest in toys made from body‑safe materials such as medical‑grade silicone, stainless steel or borosilicate glass. These materials are non‑porous and easy to clean, reducing the risk of irritation or infection.</p>
    <p><strong>Clean before and after use:</strong> Wash your toys according to the manufacturer's instructions using warm water and mild soap or a dedicated toy cleaner. Proper labeling helps consumers understand how to maintain their products. Dry thoroughly before storage.</p>
    <p><strong>Use the right lubricant:</strong> Water‑based lubricants are safe for most toys and body types. Silicone‑based lubricants can damage silicone toys, so always check the compatibility. A little lube goes a long way toward enhancing comfort and pleasure.</p>
    <p><strong>Don't share without protection:</strong> Sharing toys can transmit infections. If you plan to share, use condoms over insertable toys and replace them between partners. Clean and disinfect the toy thoroughly between uses.</p>
    <p><strong>Follow safety standards:</strong> When purchasing electronic or battery‑operated toys, look for products tested to recognized safety standards such as UL and ASTM. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission expects importers to ensure products pose no unreasonable risk. Some products may also carry California Proposition&nbsp;65 warnings if they contain substances known to cause harm.</p>
    <p><strong>Know the law:</strong> Adult toys are intended for adults. The legal age to purchase sex toys in the U.S. is generally 18. Online retailers like ours ship orders in plain, unmarked packaging to protect your privacy.</p>
    <p>By following these guidelines, you'll be better prepared to enjoy your toys safely and confidently.</p>
