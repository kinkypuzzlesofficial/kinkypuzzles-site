      <p>Exploring sex toys can be exciting, but it’s important to prioritise your health and safety. Here are some tips to help first‑time users enjoy their new purchases responsibly.</p>
      <p><strong>Choose body‑safe materials:</strong> Look for toys made from non‑porous materials like silicone, glass or stainless steel. International standard ISO 3533 sets design, material and labeling requirements for sex toys, ensuring products have features like flared bases and retrieval cords to prevent injury.</p>
      <p><strong>Understand regulatory guidance:</strong> In the U.S., there is no federal sex toy standard, but the Consumer Product Safety Commission expects importers to ensure that toys pose no unreasonable risk. California’s Proposition 65 requires warnings for products containing certain chemicals like phthalates, so check labels and avoid toys that don’t disclose their materials.</p>
      <p><strong>Clean before and after use:</strong> Wash toys with warm water and mild soap or a specialised toy cleaner. For toys with motors or batteries, make sure they are waterproof before submerging them. Let them air dry completely before storage.</p>
      <p><strong>Use compatible lubricants:</strong> Water‑based lubricants are safe with all materials, whereas silicone‑based lubes can degrade silicone toys. Always read manufacturer instructions.</p>
      <p><strong>Store discretely and safely:</strong> Keep toys in a clean, dry place away from extreme temperatures. Use storage bags or cases to prevent dust and damage.</p>
      <p><strong>Know the legal requirements:</strong> You must be at least 18 years old to buy sex toys in the United States, and reputable retailers implement age verification. At KinkyPuzzles we ship all orders in plain, unmarked packaging for your privacy.</p>
      <p>Following these guidelines will help ensure that your first sex toy experience is pleasurable and safe. As you explore more products, continue to seek out quality materials and pay attention to safety certifications.</p>
