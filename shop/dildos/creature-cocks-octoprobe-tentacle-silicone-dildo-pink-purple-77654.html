This dildo features a lifelike shape and contours that provide satisfying penetration on your terms. Crafted from body‑safe silicone that's both flexible and firm, it's compatible with most harnesses and strap‑on systems. The sculpted shaft delivers stimulating texture, while the pronounced head provides a satisfying pop upon insertion. The smooth, non‑porous material warms quickly to your body's temperature for a more natural feel. Store your toy separately from other silicone items to avoid chemical reactions and keep it in a cool, dry place. For best results, pair with a high‑quality water‑based lubricant to protect delicate materials. Always clean your toy before and after each use with warm water and mild soap or a specialised toy cleaner. Discreet packaging and billing ensure your privacy from the moment you order to the second it arrives at your door.", "sku": "XR-AH374", "brand": {"@type": "Brand", "name": ""}, "offers": {"@type": "Offer", "price": "100.91", "priceCurrency": "USD", "availability": "https://schema.org/InStock"}}</script>
