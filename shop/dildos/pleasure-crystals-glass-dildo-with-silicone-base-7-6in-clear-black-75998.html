Crafted from body‑safe silicone that's both flexible and firm, it's compatible with most harnesses and strap‑on systems. The sculpted shaft delivers stimulating texture, while the pronounced head provides a satisfying pop upon insertion. Always clean your toy before and after each use with warm water and mild soap or a specialised toy cleaner. Store your toy separately from other silicone items to avoid chemical reactions and keep it in a cool, dry place. For best results, pair with a high‑quality water‑based lubricant to protect delicate materials. Discreet packaging and billing ensure your privacy from the moment you order to the second it arrives at your door.", "sku": "CN-10-0552-00", "brand": {"@type": "Brand", "name": ""}, "offers": {"@type": "Offer", "price": "74.56", "priceCurrency": "USD", "availability": "https://schema.org/InStock"}}</script>
